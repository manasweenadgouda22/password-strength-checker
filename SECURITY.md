# Security Policy

- This project is for educational/research purposes. Do **not** log or store real passwords.
- Avoid evaluating real user passwords in production without a privacy review.
- If you deploy the API, enable HTTPS and rate limiting.
- Consider integrating offline breach data checks (e.g., k-anonymity style lookups) rather than sending plaintext to external services.
- Report vulnerabilities by opening a private security advisory on GitHub.
